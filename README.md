# 📝 Blog Web Application

A full-stack blogging platform built with **Node.js**, **Express**, and **EJS**. Users can create and view blog posts through a clean interface powered by **Bootstrap 5**.

> ⚠️ **Note:**  
> - Blog posts created are **not stored permanently** — they reset on page refresh or server restart.  
> - The layout is **not yet fully optimized for mobile devices**. Full mobile support is planned in a future update.
> - This site is hosted using render so if site is not loaded when opened refrsh it and wait for some time
